# AirmobiSim Project

## Quick Start:
AirMobiSim requires OMNeT++ 6 Pre 10 to be installed and part of your PATH.
All required dependencies will be locally installed using pyenv and poetry by executing the ```build.sh``` script:
```Bash
./build.sh
```
## Run AirmobiSim
To run the project use the following command in 'poetry shell':
```Bash
poetry run ./airmobisim.py
```

The above command will run the simulation and display the simulated plot.
To run the simulation without plot use :

```Bash
poetry run ./airmobisim.py  --plot 0
```

## Kinematic Models

AirMobiSim provides two different mobility model.
1. Linear_mobility
2. Spline_mobility

To switch between mobility model you need to change boolean values of two attributes in 'airmobisim.py' file:
1. linearMobilityFlag
2. splineMobilityFlag

Set the attribute value to 'True' depending on your choice of choice of model.

## Configure a simulation
The input parameters for the simulations are taken from a file named ```simulation.config```.
An example is located in the ```examples``` directory.


## Test Cases
Test cases are located inside the `test` directory. The idea is to perform smoke test for the project. To run the test:

```Bash
- cd test
- poetry run python3 test_airmobisim.py   or python3 -m unittest

```
